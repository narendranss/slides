Current systems like Maven helps us to create static modules.

Frameworks like Spring help in making dependency injection possible to replace an API implementation with another one during compile time.

System like OSGi facilitates Runtime Modularity with discoverability and by maintaining the life cycle of modules.

=== JPMS

JPMS fits as shown in the current system.
It has all potential to replace maven but it cannot without a repository like maven.

It can provide facilities similar to DI.

It provides runtime modularity but its support for discovery and life cycle maintenance of modules is limited.
