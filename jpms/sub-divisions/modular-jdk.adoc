New Languages like Ceylon, TypeScript and new Frameworks like Angular 2/4 supports provides first class support for Modules. It itself are modular by nature.

Why not JDK?

The JDK itself has be split into various modules based on Java Platform Module System.
Thereby if a module is not used in JDK, it is no more going to get loaded in your "module paths" and "class paths".
While we create an JDK Image with Jlink tool, it is no more going to be present in the image.
