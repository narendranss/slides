== API Enhancements
There are various small changes. Even if we don't leverage JPMS, once we onboard Java 9, we can make use of these small enhancements immediately.

=== Collection Factories
----
/* Comment sections would break ... */
List<Integer> listOfNumbers = List.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5
                                        /*, null*/);

Set<Integer> setOfNumbers = Set.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5/*, 1*/);

Map<String, String> mapOfString =
    Map.of("key1", "value1", "key2", "value2");

Map<String, String> moreMapOfString =
    Map.ofEntries(
        Map.entry("key1", "value1"),
        Map.entry("key2", "value2")/*,
        Map.entry("key1", "value3")*/
);

=== HTTP API

HTTP API

----
/**
 * The HTTP API functions asynchronously 
 * and synchronously. In
 * asynchronous mode, 
 * work is done in threads (ExecutorService).

public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
  HttpClient.getDefault()
    .request(URI.create("https://www.exxcellent.de"))
    .GET()
    .responseAsync() // CompletableFuture :D
    .thenAccept(httpResponse ->
        out.println(httpResponse
        .body(HttpResponse.asString()))
    );
  Thread.sleep(999); // Give worker thread some time.
